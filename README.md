*Project Description*
*Title*- TechBuddy

*Brief* - Chatbot which helps in practice based learning.

*Problem Statement* - In the current digital era tutorial for learning skills are crowded in market. And Person taking tutorial blindly follow the tutorial and complete it without any practice and knowing real world application examples of the topics. At the end person can't build anything using skill he learnt without practicing also this create a self doubt.

*Solution* - We are building website in which AI chatbot is integrated, Daily after completing the tutorial person can come to our website , where he get to interact with AI chatbot. He can tell which topic he studied today. Based on the topic AI will generate 5 practice questions which includes 3 quiz and 2 real world practice question. And next when person returns he can also take 2 practice question of previous day topics with Additional to daily practice question. USP of this product is that every question solved by person, he gets points and this points can be exchanged to coupons. Which can be used to buy products.
